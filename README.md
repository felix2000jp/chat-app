# Chat

## What

**Chat** is a web application where users can create and enter rooms to chat with their friends with real-time communication.

## Why

This project served mostly as a way of learning about web sockets, particularly using SignalR.

This project also serves an educational role as I want to use this to learn a new stack of web technologies to use on future projects.
